Every blog must have its fist post, and this is it. I've been meaning to do this for a long time, but always got hung up choosing the software to make it with or even with styling that software.

I ended up going with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress") and making changes primarily to the CSS. The default theme uses SASS and it's organized well, so making it look a little less like the 1000 other Octopress blogs out there was pretty easy.

The first post will be a writeup on [Song-Votr](http://http://song-votr.herokuapp.com/ "Song-Votr Demo"), since I saw a [tutorial](http://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/09/building-a-real-time-sms-voting-app-part-1-node-js-couchdb.html) on how to build something pretty similar (down to the name "Votr"). Hopefully that will be up by the end of the weekend!
